### data-preprocessing steps

Folder structure:
data_raw: observation level data and site location data required for pooling up to island level. Any interim data files are generated in here to get to the analysis ready data
lib: functions for preprocessing
munge: sequential set of pre-processing scripts


All of the analysis ready files generated from munge are pushed direct to the higher level data folder

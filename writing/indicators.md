# reef-indicators
## Indicator definitions

Indicators are compiled using island-level means.

**1. Biomass (kg per m²)**

 Definition: total reef fish biomass

 Procedure: sum all species estimates across SPC and TOW data.
 
 Reference: McClanahan et al. (all the time)

**2. Abundance (individuals per m²)**

 Definition: total reef fish abundance 

 Procedure: DO THIS LATER. ONLY NON-BIOMASS INDICATOR.

**3. Large fish indicator**

 Definition: biomass of fish > 1kg as proportion of total fish biomass

 Procedure: sum biomass of all fish in bins > 1kg, and divide by total fish biomass
 
 Reference: Greenstreet et al. (??); Robinson et al. (in review)

**4. Mean fish mass (g)**

 Definition: mean fish mass
 
 Procedure: estimated by data cleaning protocol

**5. Mean fish length (cm)**

 Definition: mean fish length
 
 Procedure: estimate by data cleaning protocol
 
**6. Max size (cm)**

 Definition: maximum asymptotic size observed
 
 Procedure: extract largest asymptotic size observed at each island
 
**7. Basal biomass (proportional)**

 Definition: intercept of logistic curve for cumulative biomass
 
 Procedure:

  Reference: Link et al. 2015; Heenan et al. in prep
   
**8. Inflexion point intercept (kg per m²)**

 Definition: cumulative biomass of trophic level inflexion point, transformed to original biomass scale
 
 Procedure:
 
  Reference: Link et al. 2015; Heenan et al. in prep

**9. Trophic level inflexion point (TL)**

 Definition: trophic level estimate at inflexion point of logistic curve for cumulative biomass
 
 Procedure:
 
 Reference: Link et al. 2015; Heenan et al. in prep

**10. Size spectrum**

 Definition: distribution of individual body masses
 
 Procedure: normalise log10 size class biomass estimates by dividing by bin width, then fit linear regression of normalised biomass ~ log10(size class) to estimate slope of size spectrum

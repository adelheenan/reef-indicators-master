## Manucsript outline

System indicators for fisheries. 

**Results**

1. Indicators - compare and contrast among islands, Spalding LME regions, and population/unimpacted regions

2. Factor analysis - identify indicators that capture distinct properties of reef fish communities

3. Environmental robustness - from factor analysis, examine environmental influences on top 2/3 reef indicators


**Figures**

1. Conceptual - what aspect of community/food web structure does each indicator capture?
2. Island variation - example of variation in indicators (e.g. size spectra against TL inflexion, scaled by total biomass)
3. Factor analysis - PCA indicating similarities between indicators
4. Environmental influences on, and factor loadings of, top indicators

*Supplementary*

Provide plots for island-level and regional means for each indicator.
